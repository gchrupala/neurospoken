# Final assignment

The final assignment in the course consists in a small (computational) research project related to the topics of the course. 

## Research

The topic should be related to neural models of spoken language, with a computational component. It should be small and focused in scope. 
You are expected to dedicate about 35 hours to this final assignment.

As an example, you could:

- replicate and refine previous findings,
- apply existing method in a new setting
- propose and evaluate an new approach to modeling or analysis

If possible, the work should be complete in the sense that you carry out a computational experiment and report results. 
At a minimum, it should be a full-fledged proposal for such an experiment, with a motivation, explicit research question, brief literature 
overview and experimental design.

## Report
You will submit a your work in the form a research paper.
This report should follow the standard paper form
with an introduction, related work, methods, results, and discussion. You are encouraged to use the following templates: 
https://www.overleaf.com/read/crtcwgxzjskr or https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/templates
The length of the report should be maximum *four pages* including figures, but excluding references.
Any code and/or data should be stored externally and linked from the methods section of the paper.


## Submission
This assignment should be handed in by sending it as a single **PDF** file to grzegorz+lot24@chrupala.me by the 
deadline specified by your program, but no later than **8 March 2024**. Any questions about additional formalities related 
to submissions should be directed to lot@uva.nl.

## Evaluation criteria
The assignment will be graded as **pass/fail** and you will not receive detailed feedback. However, keep in mind the following
properties of a high quality research paper while working on your project:


### Introduction 
The research question is specific, answerable and clearly described. The research is motivated. Main findings are briefly summarized. 
The claims match the content of the paper.

### Related work
The breadth of the relevant literature is appropriate. The literature review the identifies research gaps and links them to 
the research question tackled.

### Methods
The explanation of research method(s) is clear and concise.
The methods are appropriate for answering the research question.


### Results and discussion
The results answer the research question, based on quantitative evaluation and/or in-depth analysis. 
The presentation of the results is clear, with appropriate level of detail.
