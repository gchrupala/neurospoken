# Preparatory assignment

For this assignment you will write a 1500-word essay on the topic of modeling spoken language, 
and specifically you will take as your starting point the following position paper:

Grzegorz Chrupała. 2023. Putting Natural in Natural Language Processing. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: 
ACL 2023, pages 7820–7827, Toronto, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics. http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.findings-acl.495

## Content

In your essay you might:

- critically reflect on one or more arguments made in the paper;
- develop further one of the points made in the paper;
- suggest specific lines of research that build on one of the proposals in the paper;
- engage with the content of the paper in some other way.

You are encouraged to refer to and build on other literature in addition to the 
position paper above.

## Format

Your essay should follow the customary conventions of a scientific article. Specifically,
make sure that the essay has a title and author's name and affiliation, is divided into sections,
contains a list of references and uses a standardized citation style such a APA.

Your essay should be approximately 1500 words long. Make sure it not deviate from this size 
by more than 200 words in either direction.

## Use of writing aids
You can use any writing aids you wish, including generative language models, but keep in mind
that you are solely responsible for the content submitted. Additionally, make sure to briefly 
credit automation tools (other than basic spell-checking) used in the assignment.
I recommend limiting the use of automation to improving your grammar and style.

## Submission
This assignment should be handed in by sending it as a single PDF file to grzegorz+lot24@chrupala.me 
by 8 January 2024 at the latest.
