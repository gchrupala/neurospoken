# Neural models of spoken language - LOT Winter school 2024

**Course description**

This course briefly introduces students to current deep-learning-based
(neural) approaches to modeling spoken language. Students learn the
fundamental concepts underlying deep learning and study in some detail
how it is applied to modeling and simulating the acquisition and
processing of spoken language. The course covers the most important
recent research and focuses on two families of approaches: (i)
self-supervised representation learning (ii) visually grounded
modeling. Students learn how to apply pre-trained models to new
utterances, and extract, evaluate and analyze representations produced
by the models.

## Assessment

The [preparatory](prep.md) and [final](final.md) assignments will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. 
With respect to the homework assignments during the course, we will check whether students hand in the assignments and, discuss the assignment in class. 
The students will receive the preparatory assignment 4 weeks before the start of the school (by e-mail, CC to LOT@uva.nl). 
The homework assignments during the course and the final assignment will be handed out in class.
